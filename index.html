  <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>MPI is a group about getting people to play FOSS games. Minetest is a great subject for this.
We are showcasing mods, showing people why they should play FOSS games, and encouraging a more open-source future.<br>
Join us at <a href="https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=14015">minetest fourm post</a> if you want to join.<br>
You can play our server @ Doopy The Server. All of our showcased mods are installed there.</p>
<p>Why are we doing this? Look at this chart:
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&q=Minetest,+Minecraft&cmpt=q&tz=Etc/GMT%2B7&tz=Etc/GMT%2B7&content=1&cid=TIMESERIES_GRAPH_0&export=5&w=500&h=330"></script>
As you can see, Minetest doesn't even have 1 point compared to Minecraft, the main block building game. Our goal is to get at least 2% search.
